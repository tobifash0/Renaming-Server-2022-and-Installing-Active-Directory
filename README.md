# ROverview: Lab 2 Renaming Windows Server 2022 and Installing Active Directory
In this home lab, I will be demonstrating the process of Renaming Server 2022 and Installing Active Directory in a home lab environment. I'll be using VirtualBox and be focusing on simulating a real-world IT setup. It serves as a practical demonstration of key IT administrative tasks, such as configuring server names, setting up Active Directory, and managing domain services.

## Objectives
- Rename a Windows Server 2022 instance to meet organizational standards.
- Install and configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
- Create and manage user accounts, groups, and security policies within Active Directory.

## Documentation
Now that we have Windows Server 2022 set up, we can proceed with installing Active Directory on our virtual machine home lab. Before that, let's rename our computer to keep things simple.
